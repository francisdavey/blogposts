For reasons that will become clear in this post, rentcharges are a bit of a legal oddity. The decision by the First_Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber) in the case of Roberts v Keegan, about the enforcement of a rentcharge, may seem a little obscure, but I think there are points of interest. Since it is a *first-tier* decision it creates no precedent.

Rentcharges are a form of real property (an incoporeal hereditament) which give someone (the "rentowner") the right to receive income from land. Rentcharges [may be registered by the land registry](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/2 "s2 Land Registration Act 2002) although registration is [voluntary](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/3 "s3 Land Registration Act 2002). 

They were, at one time, a popular way of earning money on property. Rather than selling property for its full price, it might be sold at a reduced, or even nil, price but subject to a rentcharge in favour of the vendor. The vendor would then be guaranteed an income out of the land they had sold.

The [Rentcharges Act 1977](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/30/contents) made a number of drastic reforms to rentcharges. [section 2](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/30/section/2) prevents the creation of most new rentcharges. There are some exceptions and one of these, "estate rentcharges", which I will discuss briefly below, is rather interesting. 

What is more existing rentcharges, except for ones that are "variable", will all cease to exist on 22nd July 2037 [section 3](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/30/section/3). While it is tempting to think their imminent demise means that they can be safely ignored by property lawyers, there are still 22 years to go - plenty of time. 

Rentcharges may also be forceably redeemed by the rent payer under [sections 8-10](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/30/part/3).

Rentcharge - real property.

Section 121, Law of Property Act 1925 gave the owners of rentcharges 3 methods of enforcing their right. One of these, the right of distress, was abolished along with other forms of distress for rent by the [Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/15/schedule/14/paragraph/23 "para 23, sch 14") on [6th April 2014](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/768/article/2/made#article-2 "art 2(1)(b), Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No. 11) Order 2014"). The other two are: a right to take possession and a right to create a trust of a lease of the land to pay off the arrearsMysteriously the decision mentions "four remedies" (see paragraph 30) but I can't make anything of that.

The remedies do not require there to have been a prior legal demand for the sums due.
