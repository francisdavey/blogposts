I am catching up with some blogposts about interesting cases this year. The first of these is Ryanair v PR Aviation.

Database directive.

Article 6(1) - exceptions ``necessary for the purposes of access to the contents of the databases and normal use of the contents by the lawful user'' does not require the authorization of the author of the database (or presumably anyone who owns the database copyright?) for any of the A5 restricted acts such as reproduction.

Article 8 - ``made available to the public'', ``lawful user'', ``insubstantial parts of its contents'' for any purposes whatsoever. but not conflict with normal exploitation or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the maker of the database. or cause prejudice to the holder of a copyright or related right 

Article 15 - no contracting out.

``For the purposes of this Directive''
